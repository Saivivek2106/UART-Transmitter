1. Plug in your Basys 3 board

Connect your Basys 3 board to your PC via the micro-USB cable.

Wait a moment for the drivers to load.

Go to Device Manager → Ports (COM & LPT) and check which COM port was assigned (e.g., COM4 or COM3).

🗂 2. Launch Tera Term properly

Open Tera Term from the Start menu.

You’ll get a pop-up titled “Tera Term: New Connection”.

Select Serial and choose your COM port (e.g., COM4).

Click OK.

If this prompt doesn’t appear:
Go to File → New Connection → Select Serial → Choose the correct COM port → Click OK.

⚙️ 3. Set the correct Serial Settings

To configure the UART settings:

Go to Setup → Serial port...

Set:

Baud rate: 9600 (or the value your UART module uses)

Data: 8 bit

Parity: none

Stop: 1 bit

Flow control: none

Click OK

🎯 4. Optional: Save Your Settings

To make Tera Term remember your settings every time:

After connecting, go to Setup → Save Setup...

Save it as teraterm.ini (this overwrites the default config).

Next time Tera Term opens, it will use your saved settings and connect to the last-used COM port.

💡 5. Test the UART Output

Set your switches to a value (like sw[7:0] = 8’b01000001 for ASCII 'A')

Press btn1 (transmit button)

Tera Term should display: A

🧪 If Nothing Shows Up:

Confirm bitstream is correctly programmed to FPGA.

Recheck the baud rate and COM port.

Check if your UART module’s Tx line is connected to the correct FPGA pin (A18 for TxD on Basys 3).

Check if btn0 is used for reset and if it's being held low unintentionally.
